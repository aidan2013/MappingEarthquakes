# MappingEarthquakes

This project is to create a visualization of the past 7 days of earthquakes with data provided by the United States Geological Survey.
Using the JSON data, three different map views were created which all provide the ability for the user to display the earthquakes, tectonic plates and/or the major earthquakes.
